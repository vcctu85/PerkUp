# PerkUp

Perk Up is an Android app that targets people with depression and social anxiety. Inspired by
Pokemon Go, Perk Up launches into an Augmented Reality experience for the user when the user is only at specific locations
that would prompt social interactions, motivating them to go out and socialize with others. We used Vuforia to integrate the
AR, FusedLocationProvider to attain the user’s location, as well as Google’s Dialogflow to implement a chatbot that the user
could talk to about their feelings.

## Final Summary
By combining what our competitor applications do into a single application and having a clear focus on mental health, we were able to put together a final application that has a lot of potential to improve the mental health of young adults going through depression. Our final design demonstrates our incorporation of feedback we received from the teaching staff and from our user interviews. The value that the users will receive from our application is a daily increase in social interaction and an alleviation of their symptoms of depression. In the future, we hope to improve on our AR feature by allowing the user to have more interactions with AR gifts and extending the geographical range of our application. Furthermore, one of our visitors at the demo showcase even suggested that we could alter this app to help people who recently moved to a new location and want to familiarize themselves with the region.
