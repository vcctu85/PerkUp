# PerkUp

Perk Up is an Android app that targets people with depression and social anxiety. Inspired by
Pokemon Go, Perk Up launches into an Augmented Reality experience for the user when the user is only at specific locations
that would prompt social interactions, motivating them to go out and socialize with others. We used Vuforia to integrate the
AR, FusedLocationProvider to attain the user’s location, as well as Google’s Dialogflow to implement a chatbot that the user
could talk to about their feelings.
